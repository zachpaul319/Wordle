# Wordle
My version of the popular game "Wordle"

NOTE: Project is still in development. I have an incorporated my version of Wordle into a mini website as part of the final project for my Intro to Website Development class. After successful navigation through the website, you will be taken to the game board where you can play the game. As of right now, the game reads from a file containing 410 five-letter words. A word is selected at random and the user has to guess what the word is. For each guess, the colors of the letters will change in correlation to the accuracy of the letters contained within the guess. To start, simply start typing in your first guess! Once you think you have it, simply press "Enter". A player can play as many times as they want. Future development of this project will consist of keeping track of user progress as they advance through the game via levels.
