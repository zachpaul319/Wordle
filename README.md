# Wordle
My version of the popular game "Wordle"

NOTE: Project is still in development. As of right now, the game reads from a file containing 410 five-letter words. A word is selected at random and the user has to guess what the word is. For each guess, the colors of the letters will change in correlation to the accuracy of the letters contained within the guess. To start, simply start typing in your first guess! Once you think you have it, simply press "Enter". The game has yet to properly handle a correct guess, as well as advancing to other levels. Future development will handle such tasks

P.S. 
The game must be run via a server of some sort (ex. LiveServer)
