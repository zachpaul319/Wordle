# Wordle
My version of the popular game "Wordle"

NOTE: Project is still in development. As of right now, the answer is set to "hello", if you'd like to test it out. In the future, the answer will change to a random
five letter word after each round. To start, simply start typing in your first guess! Then, press "Enter", and see how correct your answer was! Again, future work will
be done to truly perfect the game
