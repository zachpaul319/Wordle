                <h3>What is Wordle?</h3>
                <p><em>Wordle</em> is a daily word game created by a Brooklyn-based software engineer named Josh Wardle. Each day,
                players are given six attempts to guess the five-letter word of the day, with color-coded boxes being used as indicators 
                of the accuracy of their guess. Featured here is my adaption, where players don't have to wait for the next day, but can
                guess as many words as they want!</p>

                <h3>What Wordle teaches us:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Developing strategy</li>
                    <li>Opening up your mind</li>
                    <li>Learn from your mistakes</li>
                    <li>Use an iterative process of thinking</li>
                    <li>In life, there will always be a new problem you can solve tomorrow</li>

                <h3>What do I do?</h3>
                <p>For full instructions, please see the "Instructions" page. In simple terms, to start, simply click "Login and Play!". After you've
                    entered your login credentials, you will be met with the 5-wide by 6-long grid that is your game board. Once you there, simply start
                    typing in your first guess! For each letter of each guess, the box will turn grey if the letter is not the guess, yellow if the letter
                    is in the word, but not in the right spot, and green if the letter is in the correct spot!</p>
